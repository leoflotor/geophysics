# Geophysics

_In collaboration with the **geophysics group** to analize the interplanetary medium. For me the goal is unknown and so does its purpouse but 
I'm gradly trying my best to collaborate and understand the physics behind the problem in quesiton. Although I'm not very good at it._

## Let's start

### Pre-requisites

Things to have installed in your pc in order correctly run the script:

* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* OMNI & HAWC data
* Python 3 libraries used in the notebooks
* **Let me remember more...**

### Indications

The path for both notebooks should be like /path/to/file/notebook.ipynb:

```
/home/usr/Documents/geophysics/analysis_hawc.ipynb
```

Two directories must be created in the same level as the notebooks. One cointaining the HAWC data per year, and the other containing the OMNI data:

```
/home/usr/Documents/geophysics/OMNI
/home/usr/Documents/geophysics/HAWC_DATA/2016
/home/usr/Documents/geophysics/HAWC_DATA/2017
```

Experienced usrs can modify the data paths directly from the notebooks.

## Collaborators

* Tatiana
* Alejandro Lara
* Angel Jara
* **More will be added, I hope...**

_Ask for permission to use their contact info._

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the most to Angel Jara, Alejandro Lara and Tatiana. Angel for introducing me to the research group, and Alejandro & Tatiana for 
guiding me through the steps forward.
